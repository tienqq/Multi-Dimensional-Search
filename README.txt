Store item's (int)id, (int)price, and (list of ints)description. Uses these characteristics to find max/min price, price range, and find item. Can also remove item completely or remove some of the descriptions number.

This program uses 2 HashMaps to store the item's id, price, and description. When inserting an item, we will store the id and price into a HashMap called priceHm and id and description into a HashMap called desHm. Due to the id being unique each of the HashMap's keys are the id. Also because the description is a set of integers, we will store those integers in a TreeSet. I use a tree set because it is faster to find a certain int within the set of ints. Also within the set of ints, each int in the description are unique to each other, which TreeSets does not allow duplicates. Methods such as Find and RemoveNames, will use their respective HashMaps. The other methods will use the desHm to get the id's and use the id's to get its price from the priceHm.
